## Getting Started
[Dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ge8dsb56vv9ofd4/movie_data.csv) consists of about 42,000 movie summaries scraped from Wikipedia. At first glance, the dataset requires some preprocessing:

* Convert the mixed date formats to one format
* Eliminate rows with NAs in the Genres column (~1% of the total observations)
* Remove punctuation and other non-words
