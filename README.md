# Automated Insights Data Science Intern Evaluation

#### Project Status: [Completed]


## Project Intro/Objective
[Dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ge8dsb56vv9ofd4/movie_data.csv) consists of about 42,000 movie summaries scraped from Wikipedia. Following given guidelines, I use natural language processing (NLP) tools with R and conduct univariate and multi-variate exploration of the dataset, summarized below:

* find the most produced and the most profitable movie genres
* identify common characteristics in movies summaries
* compare the word usage in the top five produced genres with Zipfâ€™s law

### Methods Used
* Text mining packages: `tm`, `tidytext`;
* Data visualization: `ggplot2`;
* Natural language Processing library: `spaCy` (wrapped in `cleanNLP`), `topicmodels`;
* Data manipulation: `tidyverse`;

### Tools
* R version 3.5.1
* Python3 (backend)

### Warning
The RDS files which are saved and loaded the [coding file](https://github.com/xjessiex/AI_Internship_Evaluation/blob/master/AI_Internship_R_Code.Rmd) may not work due to the limitation in push size of GitHub.
